# Machine and Data Learning Miniproject

In the project we have worked on a dataset of 8000 samples and produced Polynomial Regression models that best fit the data. Further analysis has been done related to the insights learnt during the training phase that have been documented in ![report.pdf](report.pdf) and ![code.ipynb](code.ipynb)
